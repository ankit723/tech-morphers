 cron job node server to send continous followups depending age of user creation

 minimal admin panel secure
 
 add convert to client button and converted to client tab in admin panel
 
 all converted clients will have there own system generated password which can be changed by the user and will have a dashbord where they can see there final quotation, aggrement, genetaed invoices documents,

 admin can select the converted client to enter the dashbord of that client but the client needs to acces the dashoard using their email and password



 now i want you to implement these

few notes
1) for document uiploading use the exsisiting google storage bucket uploading functionality
2) keep these functionality minimal do not need too much of overly complecated logic 
3) just keep the design moderna dn proffesional
