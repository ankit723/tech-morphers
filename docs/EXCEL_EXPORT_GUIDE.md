### File Structure
```
lib/
  excelExport.ts          # Utility functions for Excel export
app/admin/invoices/
  page.tsx               # Main invoices page with export functionality
```

## Data Included in Export

Each invoice record includes:

## Customization Options

### Export Options
```typescript
interface ExcelExportOptions {
  filename?: string;
  includeStatus?: boolean;    // Status-wise sheets

  autoFitColumns?: boolean;   // Auto-size columns
}
```

### Column Configuration
Columns can be customized in `INVOICE_EXCEL_COLUMNS`:
- Width adjustments

- Custom formatters
- Additional data fields

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Exports are processed client-side
- Large datasets (>1000 records) may take time
- Progress indicators provide user feedback

### Data Accuracy
- Real-time data from current filters
- Date calculations use user's timezone
- Status mapping ensures consistency

### File Management
- Automatic filename generation prevents conflicts
- Date-stamped files for easy organization
- Clear naming convention for filtered exports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Export not working**: Check browser permissions for downloads
2. **Missing data**: Verify applied filters
3. **Large file size**: Consider filtering data before export
4. **Date format issues**: Dates use DD/MM/YYYY format

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- JavaScript enabled required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Custom column selection
- Additional export formats (CSV, PDF)
- Scheduled exports
- Email delivery of exports
- More granular filtering options
- Chart generation in Excel

## API Integration

The export functionality integrates with:
- `/api/admin/invoices` - Invoice data retrieval
- Client-side filtering and processing
- Real-time statistics calculation

## Security Considerations

- Admin-only access to export functionality
- Data exported only for authenticated users
- No sensitive data exposure in file URLs
- Secure file download mechanism
